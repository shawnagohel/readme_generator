## USER STORY

AS A developer
I WANT a README generator
SO THAT can quickly create a professional README for a new project


## DESCRIPTION

As a developer your github portfolio is your public resume.  A well organized, easy to read github allows you to seamlessly show off your work and skills to other developers as well as potential employers.   An important communication tool are your README.md files that go along with every project.

A README will easily convey to the reader what your application does and the programming languages used to build the product. A good README will explain the challenges that you (and your team) came across and goals you have for your application in the future.  A well written README will help differentiate your GitHub portfolio from other developers.

In order to write a good README, you need the following :

Title
Short description of the your application
What the motivation was behind the application
Why you build the product
What problem does this solve
Table of Contents (if your README is long)
Installation
Contributors
Usage

Very good READMEs will include the following more personal touches :

What makes your product stand out
What did you learn during production

Badges aren't _necessary_, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.
